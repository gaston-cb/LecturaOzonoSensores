  @brief Reading ozone concentration, A concentration of one part per billion (PPB).
  @n step: we must first determine the iic device address, will dial the code switch A0, A1 (ADDRESS_0 for [0 0]), (ADDRESS_1 for [1 0]), (ADDRESS_2 for [0 1]), (ADDRESS_3 for [1 1]).
  @n       Then configure the mode of active and passive acquisition, Finally, ozone data can be read.
  @n note: it takes time to stable oxygen concentration, about 3 minutes.
